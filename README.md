<h3>Abount me:</h3>  
 <p>
  I was a back-end, fullstack and mobile developer, now I'm a front-end engineer.
  I have experience from big to small companies and in different products types, as Payment methods, chatbots, help/service desk and now with food delivery.
  I’ve always been adapting and learning new technical concepts and ways of leading.
  Day by day, I seek to act maintaining the passion for what I do, with sense of ownership and balancing between the human and the rational.
  Technically I’ve been dealing with Javascript with a main focus in React, but I’ve worked with VueJS, NodeJS (and its ecosystem technologies), React Native and today I'm an enthusiastic of NextJS.

🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
I'm planning to reorganize my GitHub.
I intend to remove old repositories and add new ones that align with my current professional focus.
