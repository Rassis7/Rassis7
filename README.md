<h4>Abount me:</h3>  
 <p>
Currently, I work as a front-end engineer with solid experience in companies of various sizes, having worked on a variety of products such as payment systems, chatbots, help/service desks, and, more recently, in the food delivery sector. My technical background is in JavaScript, with a primary focus on React and NextJS, although I also have experience with VueJS.
I am currently specializing in Artificial Intelligence and returning to back-end development, using technologies such as GO, NodeJS, and Python, while still maintaining my front-end role. Additionally, I have an interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain, areas in which I am beginning to develop expertise.
